## Video Games, Violence & the Culture of Militarism


This film focuses on first person shooters and culture around them. This genre is home to 
some of the most successful games in the industry. Instead of repeating debates that have
been made regarding whether or not video games can be directly linked to an individual's
specific violent act or claiming that video games have no effect on people, this movie
explored what effect games might be having on us and how the recurring themes are a 
commentary on our culture as a whole. 

These types of games often sanitize, glamorize, and normalize violence and then directly 
relate those themes to the idea of hyper-masculinity, so if you don't uphold those themes
you are weak and not a "real" man. Some studies have shown that people lose some of their
day-to-day empathy and have come to accept a more militarized world as a result of being
desensitized in part by graphic images and settings in video games. On the other hand these
types of games are able to be used in training soliders and medical professionals for 
scenarios, in which they will need to be desensitized to potentially save lives. 

A few other reasons violence is so prevalent in games is the fact that it's cheap to produce
and travels well. Violence is able to cross more cultural borders than more narrative based
games. 

Finally this film explored the long standing working relationship between the game
industry and the US military and gun industry. Recruiters are often found at game related
expos and there are some games that actually have explicit ads for and guides on how to 
join the army in them. The gun industry basically gets free product placement in games.
It has become a selling point for games to be ale to state that they have the most 
realistic weapons and will make deals with/get hands on experience with manufacture's 
weapons to go in the game.
